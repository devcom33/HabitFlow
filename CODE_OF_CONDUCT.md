We commit to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Showing empathy and kindness toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Harassment in public or private
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive or unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting [@devcom33](https://github.com/devcom33) directly.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
