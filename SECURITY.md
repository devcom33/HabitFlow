## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open an issue**.  
Instead, report it directly to [@devcom33](https://github.com/devcom33).

We will investigate and resolve legitimate issues as quickly as possible. Your report will remain confidential until a fix is released.
